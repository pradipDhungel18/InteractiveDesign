      <a href="https://twu.edu/"> Texas Woman's University</a>. This project is
      created as an example of learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will be
      using this project to implement everything I have learnt about HTML, CSS
      and Javascript. This project is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      Here, I have used HTML to create the layout and view of this project, CSS
      to style the associated pages and Javascript to add functionality in the
      project. Please go though the project and provide me the feedback on:
